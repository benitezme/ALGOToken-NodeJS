# ALGO Token NodeJS client

The Superalgos Project is evolving trading intelligence through the global collaboration of humans and machines. At the heart of this collaboration is a decentralized ecosystem that enables joint ownership by its stakeholders giving access to a myriad of business opportunities and value generated by the system.

The ALGO Token Smart Contracts are just a first, but extremely vital, step to enabling that collaboration between humans and machines.

This repository is the NodeJS-based exploration of the ALGO Token Smart contracts with the original contracts and .Net development tools to be found in the main [Superalgos ALGOToken Github repo](https://github.com/Superalgos/ALGOToken).

To help future contract explorers and auditors dive into the smart contracts, an attempt to provide deep documentation as well as testing and development tools is included in this repo. Documentation can be viewed at [https://algotokensmarkcontracts.netlify.com](https://algotokensmarkcontracts.netlify.com) or run locally.

## Testing setup

Testing default for ethereum network is locally via Ganache or provider of choice. _truffle.js_ may be edited to include other networks such as Infura endpoints to testnet or mainnet. Further instructions in _truffle.js_.

## Using and developing the Documentation
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is used to render and make documentation accessible. To develop locally:

```
cd website
npm install
npm run start
```

Documentation will automatically open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
