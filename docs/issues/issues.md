title: Overview

Issues are problems or vulnerabilities with the smart contracts. They are ranked and organized by severity. Closed issues are archived in the [resolved] section.

## Risk Rating

Issue risk is simply organized by severity levels of critical, high and low. A more systematic process can be adopted, such as the [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology), if the need arises.

Determination guidelines are as follows:

- **Critical Risk**: Issues and vulnerabilities that cost the project or stakeholder unlimited amount of funds or access to information leading to such outcome.
- **High Risk**: Issues and vulnerabilities that cost the project or stakeholder a limited and pre-calculatable (before contract deployment) amount of funds or access to limited private, but not critical, stakeholder information.
- **Low Risk**: Not about fund or information lost. Minor problems or improvements, e.g. such as gas efficiency.
