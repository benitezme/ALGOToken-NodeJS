 The ALGO Token Playground is included in the main ALGO Token repo and is a command-line based tool for interacting with the contracts. This playground is one of the best places to start in getting familiar with the interactive flow of the ALGO smart contracts.

 View the [ALGO Token Playground README](https://github.com/Superalgos/ALGOToken/tree/master/labs/algo-token-playground) to get started.
