The Smart Contract audit process investigates Solidity contracts to find bugs, vulnerabilities and risks before the code is deployed and used within the main Ethereum network. At this point, the code is no longer modifiable. As this code may be bound to assets with real world value, the responsibility and due diligence to this burden must be handled accordingly.

The documentation, related tools and tests within this code repository makes no statements, guarantees or warranties about the utility of the code, safety of the code, suitability of the business model, regulatory regime for the business model, or any other statements about fitness of the contracts to purpose, or their bug free status. This documentation is for discussion purposes only.

## Known Limitations

#### Technological State of development
In terms of maturity, the technology and the associated practices of cryptocurrencies, et al, is in its infancy. The Ethereum network was only initially release in July 2015 and Solidity, one of the main smart contract development languages, only since 2016. As such, related tools and understandings are under heavy development.

#### Expertise and Experience


#### Language Fluency
The main language used in the ALGO Smart Contracts is Solidity. It is a high-level language(influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript) focused on contract development. As with all languages, the intent is to enable communication, and more specifically to programming languages, enabling humans to communicate with machines. However an inherent two-fold source-of-error arises from semantic variations between all participants of said communication â€” firstly through projected intention and secondly by translation upon reception. These errors are further compounded by familiarity or fluency in the form/language of communication and total understanding of definitions, grammar and social nuance.
