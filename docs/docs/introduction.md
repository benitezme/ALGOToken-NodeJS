### Crafting the Superalgos Ecosystem

**A decentralized, self-sustainable and self-regulating economic environment**

The Superalgos Project is evolving trading intelligence through the global collaboration of humans and machines. At the heart of this collaboration is a decentralized ecosystem that enables joint ownership by its stakeholders giving access to a myriad of business opportunities and value generated by the system.

Though decentralized ecosystems are still highly experimental and have issues that need resolving, there is a clear intention of reducing friction between stakeholders; e.g., increasing value distribution and retention for contributors by minimizing middleman or third-party intermediaries. There are potential tradeoffs such as loss in flexibility for immutability and transparency mixed with a complete shift in terms of efficiency. In general, they provide the benefits of being paperless, cost-effective, secured, precise, trustless, autonomous and time-efficient.

Smart contracts act as a binding agreement transcribed into code. They should be self-verifiable, self-executable and tamper proof. From a purely rational and logical point of view, this creates an ideal situation where "code is law" and the only options are to meet the terms of the agreement or make no exchange at all. However, is the constant reminder of tools and the tools users — people; logic and rationality are only a subset of driving human characteristics with the open possibility of altered interpretation or even complete bypass of the code-as-law. It is from this reality that rigor, determination, creativity and constant vigilance must be taken up in performing the due diligence when developing and reviewing smart contracts.
