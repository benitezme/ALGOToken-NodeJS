# ALGO Token NodeJS server

This is a test backend server script for connecting to and interacting with Algo Smart Contracts.

- Currently we are using the Infura provider to connect to Ropsten testnet. [Get an API Key](https://infura.io/signup) if you don't have one yet
- Copy and rename sample.env to .env. **Highly recommended that you delete the contents of .env when not using to protect your private keys**
- Private keys can easily be obtained from creating wallet with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [MEW (My Ether Wallet)](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

### Setup

```
npm install
```

### Running the server

```
npm run start
```
